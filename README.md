# Whispers

Whispers provides a free mode of communication to people stuck in situations like internet blackouts in order to communicate with the world, with one-another or to connect to the nearest healthcare/welfare centres if needed. It could also be used by tourists to remain in touch with each other during their visit to remote areas or while their stay in internet-less hotels.
Moreover, it would also provide true anonymity to our users which would give them courage to narrate their opinions more openly and without any fear.

# Setup

The project requires Android Studio to build and to get it installed on your device. 


# How to use...

After downloading the project to your local storage, compile it using Android Studio and install it on your Android phone.

In order to form a local group, press the "Discover Groups" button to create a group of your own which can be joined by other users nearby. 

In case you want to join groups formed by other users, press the "Join Group" button and any local offline group created by Whispers would be joined by your phone.
